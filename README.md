### Task
Clean and analyse sales data to create a dashboard that tracks KPIs and provides relevant insights to support business growth.

### Sample Dashboard Questions
- What is the trend for monthly revenue?
- Which product generates the most revenue?
- What is the most popular brand?
- How is each store performing?
- What are the stock levels for each product?
- Who are the top customers by location?

### Recommendations
Incorporating these recommendations can help ensure business growth and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty:
1. **Product Focus**: The `Top 10 Products` table shows that Trek models generate significant revenue. These products can be further promoted or bundled with complementary items to drive sales. Investing in the marketing and inventory of these high-performing models can optimise revenue.
2. **Late Delivery Rate**: The late delivery rate stands at 30.60%. Reducing this number should be a priority as improving delivery times and reliability can enhance customer satisfaction and lead to repeat orders. Investigating this issue further on the `Stores Page` it is evident that Baldwin store late delivery rate is going down, while Rowlett and Santa Cruz are going up. To address this issue it may be beneficial to streamline the supply chain, work on efficient inventory management, or collaborate with efficient logistics partners.
3. **Store Performance**: Santa Cruz and Rowlett have shown a positive growth rate over the previous month (+33.75% and +32.94% respectively), while Baldwin has shown a major increase (+107.05%). Investing more resources and marketing efforts in the high-growth store while also strategising for the consistent growth of other stores can be beneficial.
4. **Product Categories**: The "Products Sold by Category" graph displays Cruisers Bicycles and Mountain Bikes as the top two categories. The business could further capitalise on this demand by offering promotions or investing in marketing centred around these popular categories. Additionally, given the rising global trend towards sustainable commuting, promoting categories like Electric Bikes (which currently has lower sales) through campaigns emphasising eco-friendliness might help tap into a growing market segment.
